# WebStore made with Angular

I made to get a better grasp of Angular and gain some more experience with node.js server. It is pretty basic and I did not spend much time on customization honestly. 


## Deployed Example 
You can visit a deployed sample here - https://angular-webstore.vercel.app/


## How to use it locally

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.1.

### Steps - 
1. Have Node installed on your computer
2. Git clone this repository
3. run `npm i` to install all the necessary packages
4. run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install Angular cli and use the commands listed below.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
